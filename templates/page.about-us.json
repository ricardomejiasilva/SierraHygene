We also manufacture premium paper hot cups. Every product we make is produced right here in the USA.\n\nFrom the beginning, we set out to be more than a traditional manufacturer. Sierra is a forward-thinking, technology-driven company focused on innovation, consistency, and long-term partnership. Over the past several years, we’ve made significant investments in fully automated, state-of-the-art production lines—enhancing efficiency, improving quality, and increasing reliability at every stage of production.",
